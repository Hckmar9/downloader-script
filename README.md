### Disclaimer

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `yt-dlp` library

## Installation

I always use virtual environments, it is not mandatory use them, but it is a best practice, so, here's basically what you need:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install yt-dlp
python3 ytdown.py
```

If anything goes weird, I left the requirements.txt so you can easily just:

```sh
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
